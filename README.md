# UnrealContentOnlyModPackagingErrorDemo

In the Demo directory there is an example of the built project.
You may also run the Javascript file to achieve a similar result, but depending on your system the pak and bin file from the mod may not copy over correctly.
Double check that they are copied correctly (if not they will be 0 bytes) and if they are not please copy them by hand using the instructions in this repository:
